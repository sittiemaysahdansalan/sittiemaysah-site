Dalumangcob Sultan Kudarat Mag. and currently studying at Notre Dame-RVM College of Cotabato.I have rude personality sometimes or maybe often thats why some people may not understand me but its fine cause there are some person's  who are staying at my side,guiding and supporting me for all the decisions I've made and I will make they are my friends and family they are my stength and weakness thats why I am pursuing my dreams not only for myself but for my family and friends to make them proud!.I never give up easily specially when it terms to my dreams.I value time because for me time is very important I dont want to waste it with non-sense things and as much as possible I want to be happy everytime so that my time is worthy.Im also an introvert person its hard for me to socialize with other people that it makes me feel uneasy but then im trying to reach out to develop my social skill.Im talkative specially to my close friends.</h3></font>!</p>
